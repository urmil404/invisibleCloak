# Invisible Cloak

Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisible cloak. Well it turns out that
using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy.
This [code](invisible_cloak.py) turns a `red` colour thing into an invisible thing , but you should use a cloth for real fun.
